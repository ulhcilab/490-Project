# 490-Project

This project is a simple VR game intended to display the quality of simple machines and their ability to create larger more complex machines.
You can move the machines by using the controllers and can attach them to others at certain attachment points and can build larger objects.

If I had more time to work on the project and more maybe more skill with unity VR software, I would of course add the final simple machine, being a pulley. I would also have liked to get a working menu in VR that spawned the objects selected. One of the final things I would have added would be a few simply puzzles that could perhaps be solved by creating larger or more complex machines.
